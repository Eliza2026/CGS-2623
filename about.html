Welcome to Cafe Paris!<br>
<br>
My name is Julie.  My husband, Nick, and I have always enjoyed cooking together and preparing dinner parties for our friends.  Nick is a professional chef and began his career as a chef in Paris at the culinary school Ecole Ducasse. Nick learned the art of preparing French cuisine using state of the art equipment and studying with renowned chefs. I met Nick while working in a restaurant up in New York, where Nick was a chef.  After we got married, we moved to Florida and after a few years of working in the restaurant business in the Tampa area, we decided to open our own French restaurant. We started this restaurant as a way to share our passion for French cooking with the community so that more people can experience the rich tapestry of French flavors and cooking.
